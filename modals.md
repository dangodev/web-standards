# Modals

User-initiated popups that allow interaction with new content

- [ ] Should only be used when the content doesn’t fit within the typical page layout, for one reason or another (e.g: unnecessary information or completing a simple action that would require reflow otherwise)
- [ ] Able to be dismissed with `Esc` key
- [ ] Are reserved for simple, single actions, and don’t contain multi-screened workflows
- [ ] Clicking / touching outside the modal or underlay should dismiss
