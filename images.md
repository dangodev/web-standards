# Images

Pictures. Can include SVG.

- [ ] Photos are optimized as `.jpg`
- [ ] `.gif` is only used if an animation is required and web-safe H.264/MPEG-4 can’t be used instead.
- [ ] `.png` is only used for low-color raster images and/or if smaller file size than `.jpg`
- [ ] Are optimized using [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/) or equivalent image optimizer

### Galleries

- [ ] Don’t resize container on image change (thus, moving the thumbnail navigation). If different ratios must be used, contain the image within the boundaries with whitespace or letterboxing.
- [ ] Allow left/right arrow key image changes, other interactions permitting.
- [ ] Should be touch-sensitive, allowing 1:1 interaction between fingers and swiping on appropriate devices.
