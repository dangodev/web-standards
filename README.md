### Goal

The goal of this project is to provide a basic website checklist that, when met, provides a friendly and usable web interface, almost like a UX version of [PageSpeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/). If the checklists for any web component become too exhastive to implement, or too opinionated to work in almost every scenario, then the project has failed.

The general idea is to focus on established web design paradigms that won’t be going away anytime soon, such as modals and image galleries. Experimental interactions will be omitted. Further, the goal of this project isn’t to assume which is right for a project; rather, it assumes the paradigms used are the correct solutions for the project and this is merely an implementation checklist to raise all solutions to completeness.
