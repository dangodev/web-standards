### Goal

The goal of this project is to make bare-minimum website checklists that are universal in application and raise web interface quality (kind of like a UX version of [PageSpeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)). No checklist items should be conditional, and the lists should remain short and readable rather than bloated and too boring to read.

The general idea is to highlight modern web paradigms that won’t be going away anytime soon, such as modals and image galleries. Experimental interactions will be omitted. Obviously, not every web project will use all paradigms mentioned, but where a paradigm is used, let’s come up with reasonable QA to make it as good as it can be.
