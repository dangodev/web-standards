This is a work in progress to try and find sane requirements for web interfaces and web content.

### Goal

The goal of this project is to provide a basic website checklist that, when met, provides a friendly and usable web interface, almost like a UX version of [PageSpeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/). If the checklists for any web component become too exhastive or too opinionated, then the project has failed.
