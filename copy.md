### Sales / Marketing

- [ ] Avoid verbs such as _try_, _attempt_, and _hope_ as well as language that opens the door to opposition (e.g.: _We <u>tried</u> to create a one-stop website for vacation rentals_)
- [ ] Avoid future tense as much as possible (if you _must_ talk about the future such as future features or changes, provide expected dates)
- [ ] Replace passive voice with active voice (e.g.: _You will receive monthly updates sent by us_ becomes _We send you monthly updates_)
