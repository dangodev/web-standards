# Copy

### Punctuation

- [ ] Feet & inches: use `′` and `″` (prime / double prime), not `'`,`"`,`’` or `”`
- [ ] Math: use `×`, not `x`
- [ ] Plurals: always avoid using `’` unless the `S` can be confused for part of the word/acronym (e.g.: _~~1990’s~~_ and _~~6S’s~~_ are wrong, but _RV’S_ and _PhD’s_ are correct)
- [ ] Quotes & apostrophes: use `“”` and `‘’`, not `"` and `'`

### Sales / Marketing

- [ ] Avoid language that invites disagreement such as _try_ and _attempt_ (e.g.: _~~We try to create a one-stop website for vacation rentals~~_ → _Your one-stop website for vacation rentals_)
- [ ] Avoid future tense as much as possible; if you _must_ talk about the future such as features in development or upcoming changes, provide expected dates for each
- [ ] Replace passive voice with active voice (e.g.: _~~You will receive monthly updates sent by us~~_ → _We send you monthly updates_)
