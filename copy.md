### Sales / Marketing

- [ ] Avoid language that invites disagreement such as _try_ and _attempt_ (e.g.: _~~We try to create a one-stop website for vacation rentals~~_ → _Your one-stop website for vacation rentals_)
- [ ] Avoid future tense as much as possible; if you _must_ talk about the future such as features in development or upcoming changes, provide expected dates for each
- [ ] Replace passive voice with active voice (e.g.: _~~You will receive monthly updates sent by us~~_ → _We send you monthly updates_)
