# Navigation

Main menu of a site.

### General

- [ ] Should never change structure or appearance (but may be replaced / modified in such cases as users’ logging in and requiring different actions than logged-out users, for example)

### Tray

The out-of-view navigation should be [avoided](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1945), but when it’s necessary:

- [ ] When open, click / touch outside the tray should close it
- [ ] Trays should animate properly, revealing their origin/exit location and with proper easing [as described here](https://material.google.com/motion/movement.html#movement-movement-in-out-of-screen-bounds) (See _Movement in and out of Screen Bounds_).
